**Description of the game:**
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a relatively easy two-player game. The game is played when the two players upon signal, simultaneously make figures with their hands. The figure could represent be a rock (by making a fist), a piece of paper (by opening the palm), or a pair of scissors (by holding out two fingers forming a V). 
Winner of the game is determined according to a set of rules. You can find the official rules under the Resources.

- If user input is invalid (not amongst our options), an `error message` is printed , and requests for user input again.
- If the two players (CPU and player) choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game restarts.
- If there is a winner, the winner is printed on the console, and the program ends.
